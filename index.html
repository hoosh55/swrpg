                <h5 class="mt-1 subheading">Aim</h5>
                <p>During combat, a character can use the Aim maneuver to steady a weapon or line up a hit before attacking, granting a bonus to his next combat check. A character only gains the benefit of aiming if he remains in his current position and does not perform any additional maneuvers or actions before his next combat check. Any damage that exceeds the character's soak also negates the benefit of aiming.</p>
                <p>Aiming provides the character with one of the two following bonuses:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Gain Boost on the next combat check.</strong> If the character spends two consecutive maneuvers aiming, he gains Boost Boost on the next combat check.</li>
                  <li><strong>Target a specific item carried by the target, or a specific part of the target.</strong> This could allow the character to attempt to strike or shoot a weapon from his opponent's hand, for example, or target an opponent's limb to cripple him. If the character spends one maneuver aiming to do this, his next combat check suffers Setback Setback If he spends two consecutive maneuvers aiming, the combat check suffers Setback instead</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li class="list-group-item" ng-if="theater === 'ground'">
                <h5 class="mt-1 subheading">Assist</h5>
                <p>Performing the assist maneuver allows an engaged ally to add Boost to his next check. Several characters can use the assist maneuver to add more bonus Boost to the engaged ally's next check. All awarded bonus dice must be used on the assisted character's next turn, otherwise they are discarded. The Game Master should use his own discretion when allowing Players to assist one another. Some actions simply do not benefit from assistance.</p>
              </li>
              <li class="list-group-item" ng-if="theater === 'ground'">
                <h5 class="mt-1 subheading">Guarded Stance</h5>
                <p>A character can take a maneuver to assume a guarded stance, helping him defend against melee attacks. A character who performs this maneuver adds Setback to any combat checks he makes until the end of his next turn. However, he also gains melee defense 1 until the end of his next turn.</p>
              </li>

                <h5 class="mt-1 subheading">Interact with the Enviroment</h5>
                <p>Often a single maneuver is enough to interact with the environment around a character. This is a broad category of possible interactions, such as opening a blast door, ducking behind a wall, pressing a specific button on a control panel, or grabbing a blaster off of the ground. The following are some more specifically designed examples of interacting with the environment:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Moving a large item.</strong> Flipping over a table, shoving a barrel into a pursuer's path, hefting a crate; all of these would take a maneuver to perform</li>
                  <li><strong>Opening or closing a door.</strong> Whether an electronic blast door or a primitive door with latches and hinges, opening or closing it takes a maneuver.</li>
                  <li><strong>Taking cover.</strong> Ducking behind a door jam, crouching behind a crate, or peeking around a tree trunk; all of these allow the character to gain ranged defense 1 (and some cover can grant a ranged defense higher than 1 if particularly sturdy). It takes a maneuver to take cover, but once in cover, the character keeps the bonus unless the circumstances around him change so that he would no longer benefit from cover, or he moves out of cover.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li class="list-group-item" ng-if="theater === 'ground'">
                <h5 class="mt-1 subheading">Manage Gear</h5>
                <p>Managing items and equipment is accomplished by this maneuver, which can cover the following options</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Draw, holster, ready, or load a weapon.</strong> This maneuver covers the basic manipulations of most weapons, such as drawing a vibroknife from its sheath, recharging a blaster rifle's energy cells (provided the character has additional ammo at hand), or drawing and prepping a thermal detonator for use.</li>
                  <li><strong>Draw something from storage, or put it away.</strong> A character can perform a maneuver to retrieve an item from a pouch, backpack, satchel, bandolier, or some other accessible container. This can also be used to stow items in a similar fashion.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li class="list-group-item" ng-if="theater === 'ground'">
                <h5 class="mt-1 subheading">Mount or Dismount</h5>
                <p>Mounting and dismounting a domesticated animal such as a trained dewback or a tauntaun requires a maneuver. (Successfully mounting an untrained animal, however, requires a Medium (Difficulty Difficulty) Survival check, which may be harder depending on how ornery the GM feels the animal is ) Similarly, mounting a vehicle, sliding into a cockpit, or otherwise engaging a vehicle for piloting or a gunnery station for use requires a maneuver as well.</p>
              </li>
              <li class="list-group-item" ng-if="theater === 'ground'">
                <h5 class="mt-1 subheading">Move</h5>
                <p>This maneuver allows the character to move within his environment. The game defines several different broad types of movement. When characters move, they do one of the following:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Change range increment.</strong> Performing this maneuver allows a character to move between short and medium range relative to another person or object This also allows characters to move between medium and long range by performing two maneuvers, or between tong and extreme range by performing two maneuvers. When covering long distances, multiple maneuvers do not have to be performed on the same turn, but the character is not considered to be in the new range increment until all required maneuvers have been performed.</li>
                  <li><strong>Engage or Disengage from an opponent.</strong> If a target is already within short range of a character, the character can perform a maneuver to engage that target. If the character is engaged with an opponent or adversary, he must perform a maneuver to disengage with that opponent before moving to any other location. This only changes his range relative to his opponent from "engaged" to "short" and represents the effort of backing away and avoiding his opponent's attacks. Characters do not need to perform this maneuver to leave an engagement consisting only of friendly characters or allies.</li>
                  <li><strong>Moving within short range.</strong> Performing this maneuver allows an unengaged character to move to another position that is currently within short range of him.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li class="list-group-item" ng-if="theater === 'ground'">
                <h5 class="mt-1 subheading">Drop Prone or Stand from Prone</h5>
                <p>Dropping prone and standing from a prone position each require a maneuver. Dropping prone allows the character to add Setback to all ranged attacks made against him, although he also must add Boost to all melee attacks made against him.</p>
              </li>
              <li class="list-group-item" ng-if="theater === 'ground'">
                <h5 class="mt-1 subheading">Preparation</h5>
                <p>Some actions require additional preparation to perform safely. The preparation maneuver is generally performed in conjunction with another ability to confer a bonus, offset a penalty, or fulfill a requirement. The individual talents or abilities that utilize the preparation maneuver define its specific effect. It is sometimes abbreviated under the requirements as "prepare."</p>
